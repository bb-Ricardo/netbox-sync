### Welcome to the NetBox-Sync configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified. The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used. Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

[common]

# Logs will always be printed to stdout/stderr.
# Logging can be set to following log levels
#   ERROR:      Fatal Errors which stops regular a run
#   WARNING:    Warning messages won't stop the syncing process but mostly worth
#               to have a look at.
#   INFO:       Information about objects that will be create/updated/deleted in NetBox
#   DEBUG:      Will log information about retrieved information, changes in internal
#               data structure and parsed config
#   DEBUG2:     Will also log information about how/why data is parsed or skipped.
#   DEBUG3:     Logs all source and NetBox queries/results to stdout. Very useful for
#               troubleshooting, but will log any sensitive data contained within a query.
